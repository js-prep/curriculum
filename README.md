## Getting Started

There are a few things we need to take care of before you start the curriculum, but don't worry! We'll lay it out step by step, and make this process painless! Don't worry about understanding how to use any of the things we're installing, we'll slowly get to that as we need them.

First things first. We ***highly*** recommend using a Mac for this program. Using a Mac will make your life multitudes easier, and our guides will be tailored for OSX.

## Cloning the Repo

1. Open the `Terminal` application.
    - `Command + F` to open Spotlight.
    - Type `terminal` and hit `Enter`.

2. Inside the terminal:
    - `cd ~/Desktop`
    - `mkdir js-prep`
    - `cd js-prep`
    - `git clone https://github.com/js-prep/curriculum.git`
    - This should create a folder called `curriculum` in your working directory.
        - You can verify by typing `ls` and seeing it come up in the terminal.

## Atom

Atom will be our go to code editor for this program. If you have a strong preference for a different editor, you're welcome to use that but this course will be tailored with examples in Atom.

1. [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. Open Atom
3. Install Atom Shell Commands: `Atom -> Install Shell Commands`

## Atom Runner

The Atom Runner is a package that exists on top of Atom that allows you to run Javascript through the editor.

To install:

1. `Atom -> Preferences`
2. Inside Atom in the `Settings` tab, `Install -> Search atom runner -> Click Install under atom-runner`.
