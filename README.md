## Getting Started

There are a few things we need to take care of before you start the curriculum, but don't worry! We'll lay it out step by step, and make this process painless!

First things first. We ***highly*** recommend using a Mac for this program. Using a Mac will make your life multitudes easier, and our guides will be tailored for OSX.

## Cloning the Repo

1. Open the `Terminal` application.
    - `Command + F` to open Spotlight.
    - Type `terminal` and hit `Enter`.

2. Inside the terminal:
    - Type `cd ~/Desktop`
    - Type `mkdir js-prep`
    - Type `cd js-prep`
    - Type `git clone https://github.com/js-prep/curriculum.git`
    - This should create a folder called `curriculum` in your working directory.
        - You can verify by typing `ls` and seeing it come up in the terminal.

## Atom

Atom will be our go to code editor for this program. If you have a strong preference for a different editor, you're welcome to use that but this course will be tailored with examples in Atom.

1. [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. Open Atom
3. Install Atom Shell Commands:
