## What is Javascript?

Javascript (or JS for short) is one of the most widely used programming languages for implementing complex and dynamic stuff on webpages. It allows web pages to interact with a variety of events that happen on the web page from user controlled events (clicking on a button) to timed events (do something after `x` seconds). Without Javascript, surfing the web would feel similar to reading the pages of a magazine or book with minimal responsiveness to handling actions.

The history and invention of Javascript is a [fun read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History) (JS was created in 10 days..!)

## How is it used?

Javascript is one of three core languages alongside HTML and CSS used to program the World Wide Web.

**HTML** builds the structure of the webpage. It creates the text, buttons, and provides the skeleton or hierarchy of the webpage.

**CSS** adds the style and look of the page. It provides colors, spacing, fonts, amongst many others to the webpage.

**Javascript** is the only functional, object oriented programming language of the three *(Don't worry too much about what this means yet)*. JS allows us to store and then use information in variables, react to user interactions on the webpage, and display dynamic content to users given the conditions we set. JS is a necessary language to employ when building intricate web pages (or even web apps: think Soundcloud, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, etc) and we'll be focusing our efforts in learning and practicing the fundamentals of JS throughout the coming weeks.

## Why Javascript?

You may have heard of other similar languages such as Java, C, C++, Python, or Ruby and may be wondering: *why Javascript?* That's a valid question, because each of these languages are widely used and have different advantages and disadvantages over one another.

The main goal of this course, however, is to guide and prepare you for a coding bootcamp. These bootcamps focus on teaching their students the necessary skills to develop and deploy web applications built using mainly.. you guessed it: **Javascript**!

Learning core concepts using Javascript will be helpful in learning other languages so try not to be so focused on the fact that we're learning JS. Many of these languages are built to handle similar concepts so JS is a good jumping point for us.

**So without further ado... let's jump in!**
